Throughout my high school and undergraduate career, I've gotten multiple internship opportunities to deepen my interests in science, politics, and law:

### Wikstom & Barney, LLC.
Led by **Erica Wikstrom**, I have spent the past two years interning the **Wikstrom & Barney, LLC** law office. I have gotten to spend time in the law office and the courtroom to learn how each aspect of the judicial process works. I have gotten to speak to multiple **attorneys, public defenders, and judges** about their experiences in and outside of court.

### State Senator Maroney Internship
In 2023, I had the opportunity to intern on Milford's ***State Senator James Maroney***'s reelection campaign. I got to talk to voters across Milford and Orange, Connecticut over what issues were affecting them most, and the type of policies they supported. I learned how campaigns functioned including how they decided which voters to approach, how candidates fundraise, and how **campaign events** were put together.

### Milford Science Camp Internship

A year ago, I interned at the Milford Science Summer Camp. I got to help teach basic science to Kindergarten - 7th Graders. It was really rewarding to see young kids start to love science, just like I did when I was their age. We did experiments relating to **physics, geology, metoerology, etc.**
