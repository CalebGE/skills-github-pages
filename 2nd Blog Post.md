Throughout my high school and undergraduate career, I've gotten multiple internship opportunities to deepen my interests in science, politics, and law:

### Wikstom & Barney, LLC.
Led by **Erica Wikstrom**, I have spent the past two years interning the ***Wikstrom & Barney, LLC*** law office. I have gotten to spend time in the law office and the courtroom to learn how each aspect of the judicial process works. I have gotten to speak to multiple attorneys, public defenders, and judges about their experiences in and outside of court.

### State Senator Maroney Internship

### Milford Science Camp Internship/Job
